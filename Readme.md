# Beiginners friendly exercises

Hello Newbies ! Including me ofcourse, this repo contains the questions for building up the logic for those who have just stepped into this world, maybe we can call it **Code War** :).

Note: These question have been picked from a neoGcamp repo [neoGcamp Build Exercises](https://github.com/neogcamp/build)

## Happy Learning, Cheers !
